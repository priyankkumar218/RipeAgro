## About
This is a part of my learning curriculum. Here i have created a ASP.NET website using webforms to show the dynamic nature of
webpages by rendering each of the elements dynamically on runtime using in-code HTML/CSS (using PlaceHolders and StringBuilders) and further fetching the data through SQL Server Databases.
